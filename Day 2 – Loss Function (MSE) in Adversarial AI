 Loss Function
A loss function tells the AI model how wrong its prediction is.
The model uses this to self-correct.
Adversarial AI uses this to exploit model weaknesseIn adversarial attacks, our goal is to:
Increase the AI's loss by making subtle changes to the input.
Track MSE to measure how much confusion we’re causing.
Loss is like the pain meter of the AI.
MSE is how we quantify that pain.
Insight:
“Adversarial AI isn’t about crashing the model — it’s about confusing it quietly.
Loss functions are how we track the confusion.”

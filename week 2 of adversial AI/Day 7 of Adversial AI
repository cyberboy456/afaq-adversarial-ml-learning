The day 7 of my work is all about the mini project for practicing the basic python syntax to help me on the gaining of good concept
first is the mini calculater 
a=int(input("enter a fisrt number"))
b=int(input("enter a second number"))
operation=input("enter operation +,-,*,/")
def calculate(a,b,operation):
    if operation=="+":
        return a+b
    elif operation=="-":
        return a-b
    elif operation=="*":
        return a*b
    elif operation=="/":
        return a/b
result =calculate(a,b,operation)
print(result)
the second is the password checker
attempt = 3
correct_username = "ali"
correct_password = "1234"

while attempt > 0:
    username = input("Enter username: ")
    password = input("Enter password: ")

    if username == correct_username and password == correct_password:
        print("Access granted ")
        break
    else:
        attempt -= 1
        print(f"Invalid credentials. {attempt} attempts remaining ")

        if attempt == 0:
            print("Access blocked ")

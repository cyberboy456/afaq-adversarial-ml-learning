Measuring AI’s prediction error using a loss function.

 What I Did
- Learned the concept of **Loss Function** in AI/ML.
- Implemented **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** to measure how far AI’s prediction is from the actual value.
- Built a `predict()` function using dot product + bias.
- Compared predictions with target values and calculated MSE.

 Core Concept:
AI uses **loss functions** to learn from its mistakes.  
The smaller the **MSE**, the better the model is performing.

 MSE Formula:**  
\[
\text{MSE} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (prediction_i - target_i)^2
\]

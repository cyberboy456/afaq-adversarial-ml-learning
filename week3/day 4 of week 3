Topic:
Reading real-world .csv data for AI predictions.
What I Did:
Used pandas to load a CSV file containing:
Input features: size, entropy, api_calls
Target value: danger_score
Extrcted features and targets from the DataFrame.
Predicted using the same AI logic (dot product + bias).
Calculated MSE for evaluation.
Core Concept:
This simulates how AI works with real datasets â€“ reading structured data from files and applying logic over multiple rows.

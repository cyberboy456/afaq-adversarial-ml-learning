Topic:
Simulating AI predictions on multiple inputs.
What I Did:
Created multiple input samples and target values.
Ran a loop to simulate AI predictions on all inputs.
Used predict() function to compute each output.
Compared predictions with targets and calculated total MSE.
Core Concept:
A real AI system processes multiple samples and uses MSE to evaluate its average error over all predictions.
